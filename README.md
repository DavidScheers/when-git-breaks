## Knowledge gap

* [ ] knowing what to ignore or delete
* [ ] Files: .gitignore, â€¦
* [ ] git merge conflicts (avoid most conflicts)
* [ ] how to avoid conflicts or resolve them.
* [ ] Revert back to older version (for everything & for only a single file)
* [ ] git remove (removed too much)

### Knowing what to ignore or delete
http://gitignore.io

### Merge conflicts
#### How to avoid
* Don't work on the same code
* Make small commits
* Integrate as fast as possible

#### Tools
* [KDiff3](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/)
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
* [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.3/using-git-integration.html), or any proper IDE actually

#### Whitespace and CR/LF conflicts
Be aware that inconsistent formatting settings on your team's workstations can cause merge conflicts that are _difficult_ to solve.

_Difficult_ because it can be hard to distinguish the important changes in between the new line changes or whitespaces.

Luckily most tools provide support to _ignore whitespace_.

#### Exercise
    git checkout exercise-start
    git merge exercise-merge-conflict

We want only the second sentence without comma's.

Your end result should look like this:
```
As you lay tonight beside me baby, I'm the one in the shootin' game
would you wait for me the other one wait for me

You run with the devil
You run with the devil
```

Save your file, and `git add` it. Don't commit just yet.

### Reverting back
Sometimes you just want to undo your changes, because :poop: happens.

Depending on which stage your changes are in, there's `git revert` and `git reset` to help you out.

#### Your changes are in your staging dir?
Use `git reset` to undo them.

#### Your changes are in a commit?
##### But you haven't pushed them to a remote yet?
You can simply modify your files the way you want, and `git amend`.

##### And you have pushed them to a remote already
Then you can `git revert`, and create a new commit with the undo.

#### Exercise
From last exercise you should have a changed file that hasn't been committed yet.

Let's undo our merge so we can start from our own (`exercise-start`) version again.

    git reset



### Note on renaming files to lowercase or uppercase
Here's a typical scenario:

You're just learning a new language and you're using another language's naming conventions.

e.g. You're working on a Java project, but you used .Net naming conventions for _packages_.

.Net convention says: Snakecase your package names: `Fleetfoxes`.

Java convention says: lowercase your package names: `fleetfoxes`.

#### Exercise
The `exercise-snake` branch contains a new directory `com/lyrics/Fleetfoxes` (mind the case).

The `exercise-lower` branch contains a commit to rename the `com/lyrics/Fleetfoxes` directory to all lowercase: `com/lyrics/fleetfoxes`.

    git checkout exercise-snake
    git merge exercise-lower

What does your directory look like? Is it `Fleetfoxes` or `fleetfoxes`?
